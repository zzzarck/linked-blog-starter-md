Your Equipment

The weapons trafficker is instructed that hes not in the station to kill, but to sell their illegal goods to both crewmates and antagonists alike, for this, the weapons trafficker is equipped with these tools at spawn:

- Smuggler's Briefcase
- Smuggler's Radio
- Business Cards
- Smuggler's Flare

The Smuggler's Briefcase is the main tool of most Illegal merchants, it allows you to obtain new goods and to gain information about the antagonists on station. On use, it will open the "Evil doers market tm", in this case the Guns and Weapons section, it allows you to:

- Talk to the weapon providers that are available and negotiate both the cut you will be getting out of the deal and where the weapons will be arriving.
- Check the reputation you have in the market (Explained bellow)
- Track the general direction and amount of antagonists in the station
- Print more Business cards
- Buy smaller illegal goods with credits

Only you can open this briefcase so don't worry about security using it to find the bad guys. Be careful tho, as this is the only one you will get, don't loose it!.


The Smuggler's looks like a normal civilian helmet but it has the frequencies to communicate with the syndicate, scavengers and security, allowing you to better get a grasp of what's happening on station and who to sell your stuff to.


The Business cards you are granted are to be given to crewmates and people you trust to not snitch on you! these work to promote your business and will announce anyone that has them when you light up a Smuggler's Flare and your exact location, you can print more of there in the Smuggler's briefcase


The Smuggler's Flare works as your way to announce you have new merchandise to anyone that has a business card, once you light it up it will be left on the ground and glow for 5 minutes, announcing everyone with a business card your location, useful to get your customers to buy your stuff without having to expose yourself.


The traders and reputation
--
Once you open your smuggler's briefcase you will be met with the traders menu, this will show you all the weapon traders that are willing to make deals with you. Traders will send you weapons for you to sell at the station and pay you accordingly for doing so, you can negotiate these deals to get a bigger cut, don't push it tho!

At the start there will be only a few traders as you have a low reputation, as you increase it however, you will unlock more influential and powerful traders that are willing to sell WAY stronger (or funnier) weapons.

when you take a deal from a trader you will have the choice to receive the goods at the location designated by the trader or choose a more comfortable one yourself (out of 3 choices) but receive 30% less money upon the completion of the deal.

There are 5 weapons dealers that you can talk to as a weapons trafficker, these are:
