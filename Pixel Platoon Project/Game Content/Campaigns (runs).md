Every game the player plays (campaigns or runs) they progress trough many missions and maps (procedurally generated), the size and the missions on a campaign depend on the difficulty selected by the player.

The campaign is divided into many missions, every time the player beats one they will have the choice of at least 2 missions after to give the player more flexibility and control.
(list of [[Missions]] here)

every campaign also has random events that happen in between of each mission, these can be negative or positive but they should always have a way to avoid to prevent luck based gameplay. These should all have flavor text to give the player more context on the war or a certain situation.
