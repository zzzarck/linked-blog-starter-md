This file contains a list of every mission in the game, both nation specific ones and general ones.

Easy Missions:
- Small Skirmish
	- Your mission is simple, take over a small town that is poorly defended, should be easy enough even with a small amount of soldiers.
- Small Scout Mission
	- Send over a small recon team at your disposal to gather information on the enemy position, avoid fights if you can as you will probably be at a disadvantage.
- Small Ambush Mission
	- Our scouts have found the perfect opportunity to ambush an enemy convoy to greatly cripple their forces, you must act quickly and prepare the ambush in a short amount of time, we expect nothing more than trucks and maybe an armored car.
- Snatch Patrol
	- Capture an enemy soldier in a nearby camp and bring them back hopefully alive for interrogation at the HQ, the camp should be pretty defenseless, you are free to do this in any way you want, be it stealthy or loud as long as you bring the enemy soldier.
- Small Sabotage Mission
	- Destroy the specified equipment at the enemy position to cripple their forces, it is not needed for you to kill everyone as this is expected to be more heavily defended than other positions. Go in, destroy the goods, get out.
