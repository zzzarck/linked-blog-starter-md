Notes

Battle Dialogues
- "Im not going back into that cage without a fight!"
- "They always called me a rat, i will show them what a real warrior can do"

Prisoner recruitment
- "Do you think i wont be able to break out of here? I already did it once and will do it again"
1. Do you think we wont be able to beat you up again? Already did it once and will do it again...
   - You better let me out of here or i'll do it myself. *End dialoge*
2. You should be thankful we didnt give turn in your bounty, you would be dead right now.
   - I would be impressed if those brutes were able to keep me in a cage for more than a few minutes.
     1. Well we are not brutes so you better start to get comfy in that cage because you will be here for a looong time.
        - It seems like you are even dumber than those bastards.(End Dialogue)
     2. I mean, they kept u prisoner for long enough to cut off your horns so i dont know about that.
        - Im going to cut your fucking head off once im out of here. (End dialogue)
     3. *Walk away* (end dialogue)
3. What did you even do to end up in this situation, you dont really look like the other sheks.
   - They caught me stealing food from a caravan passing by in squint, They shame me for "not being a warrior" and then jail me when i try to get something to eat after days? Those brainless brutes...
     1. Maybe you should grab a real sword and not go stealing stuff around, coward.
        - it seems like your even dumber than those bastards. (End dialogue)
    2. Maybe if you join us u might have a chance on having your revenge on the sheks.
        - Bah! Do you really think i will belive those lies coming from someone as barbarian as the sheks? Maybe come back when your skills are even to my level hah! (End dialogue)
    3. (At least 20 katana skill) Well the way you fought with that katana in battle looked very warrior-like to me.
     - Heh, maybe you're smarter than you look if you can recognise a real warrior. 
        1. Well if you ever want to be able to defeat those brutes u could come with us.
         - You know what? Why not, you do look like a great training partner. (Recruit)
        2. The way you fight doesnt put away the fact that you are a filthy thief tho.
         - it seems like you are even dumber than those bastards (end dialogue)
