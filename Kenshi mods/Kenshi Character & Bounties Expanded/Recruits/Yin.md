Recruitment dialogue:

- Hey, drifter, have you seen this man? *Shows a picture of him with a crudely drawn moustache*
  1. That's just you with a moustache old man.
   - Who did you just call old? And this is a very dangerous man, if you are not going to take this criminal seriously I'm wasting my time speaking to you, be gone kid.
  2. By okran's light! That man looks hideous, he must surely be some wanted criminal.
    - I'm glad there is still some clarity in this generation, of course he is, one of the most wanted criminals indeed, so have u seen him?
        1. No, but i don't think you are going to find him by sitting in this bar forever you know?
            - I've been looking for this man for years already, and all my attempts have been futile, my body is not the same anymore but i guess you are right, i might give it a last try, i could use a team if you think yourself worthy of such enormous task.
                1. Of course old man, Together we will be able to find this horrible looking criminal, no spot will be left unsearched.
                2. I'm sorry but i don't think I'm worthy of such massive task, you should probably wait until you find some kind of unbeatable soldier?
        2. I have actually, i think I'm currently looking at him right now... and he's pretty old.
        3.
