Recruitment dialogue:

- Who are you?
  1. Just an adventurer, you seem a little lost.
    - I don't know where i am... Have you seen the queen?
     1. I don't think the queen is anywhere close to here buddy.
        - But the others told me i need to save her, she is trapped in the ashlands!
         1. I think you just were exiled from your hive...
            - Maybe they did, the queen wasn't there...
             1. Wait, you made it to the Ashlands and came back alive?!
                - Yes, i would do anything for the queen... But i don't know what to belive anymore.
                 1. Well, maybe you can find your place in my squad if you are willing to.
                    - I don't think im allowed back into the hive anymore anyways... (Joins)
                 2. I can only hope you find your place around here soon, try to stay safe.
                    - ...
                 3. (Walk Away).
