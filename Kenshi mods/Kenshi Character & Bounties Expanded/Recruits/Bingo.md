Recruitment:

- Hey, you look like a wanderer, looking for a chef? I'm tired of cooking in this bland city and could and i think if i cook one more rice bowl i'll snap.
  1. Why do you want to go outside of the safe walls in the city?
    - As i said, i've literally cooked every single piece of scrap in this city, i'm looking for something more... exotic, something with more flavour that gives me the joy i once had for cooking back.
