The Beast hunters are a faction located in the leviathan coast, they hunt leviathans for food and money and are in a constant war with the cannibals.

They have managed to push mostly all cannibals out of the plains and exiled them into the hidden forest, opening up new trade routes with the other factions across the northen coast and purple sands.

Their cities have a big amount of ranger equipment of the highest quality and also lots of bars, not a lot of armor or weapons tho. 

They are neutral to the player faction and able to ally them with a questline or defeating the remains of the cannibals.

Their cities and outposts can be found in:

- [[Leviathan coast]]
- [[Cannibal Plains]]
- [[The iron trail]]
- [[Purple Sands]]
- [[Northen Coast]]
