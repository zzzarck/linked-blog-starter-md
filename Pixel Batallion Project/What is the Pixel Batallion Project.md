The pixel batallion project is my go at making a mobile game, it is inspired on the call to arms dynamic campaign mode, but with more roguelike elements and a 2d pixel art syle.

The game is focused on the ww2 era and the player is tasked with commanding a batallion that starts small but grows with upgrades the player chooses and many random units and events.

The game aims to have 2 factions at release these being USA and Germany, being able to play as both. Later on i aim to add the following factions: Japan, United Kingdom, Soviet union and France.

For now the main goals, which are essential to the release are:

- A [[Procedurally Generated Campaign]] mode.
- 2 [Factions](List of factions) to play as
- A big selections of units to customize the batallion
- A research tree to unlock stuff midgame
- Different Difficulties
- Currency to spend before the game starts
