This project is my attempt at actually doing something significant out of my ideas while also helping me learn various new skills.

This will start as a normal worldbuilding project, invisioned as a post apocaliptic world with a (hopefully) quite complex yet interesting diplomacy and nation system, this is expected to take months or even years to get it in a state i am happy with however i will give it my best to work on it daily to train my discipline.

The world is inspired by various of my own ideas but also many games that have made me realize how much effort goes into making something enjoyable, taking years to even make a prototype, but also how rewarding it must be, not only to see the finished project but also the path you had to make, and the many skills and lessons you learn in the process, its something that has truly amazed me.

After the Worldbuilding part of the project i expect it to take it to the bigger picture, i however do not know what this will be yet, it could be a game, a book, a series, but the point is for me to make something out of it in the end.
