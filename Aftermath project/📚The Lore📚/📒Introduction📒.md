Emergence
--

Its the year 2186, The Union of Earth's People has established colonies all across the galaxy in many barren planets after the many great advancements in colonial technology, many of these colonies struggle to expand past their landing spots where the habitat ships reside due to the many environmental dangers, however, this year, out of seemingly nowhere in a nearby solar system a habitable planet full of life appeared, research teams were dispatched to enter orbit of the planet as soon as it was noticed, the feed obtained from the ship's orbital enhanced cameras showed massive amounts of flora and fauna.

The higher ups at Earths capital decided to continue with research attempts while being extremely careful due to the mysterious nature of the planet, having no idea of where it came from and it being strangely perfect for human inhabitation.

The Research
--
In the year 2187 many of earth's most advanced scout droids were sent to gather samples from the planet after enough evidence of the planet's surface being safe was obtained from the multiple orbital scans, the scouts came back after completing their mission successfully surprisingly without any complications, the scouts managed to obtain a massive amount of samples and data allowing earth's researchers to explore both flora and fauna without stepping foot into the planet.

After many samples were analyzed, in the year 2188, the first colonizers were sent after the excitement among the people in earth became too much, and the overpopulation was affecting more people day by day. Many research groups opposed this idea but soon a planet wide vote was enacted with votes favouring the human exploration of the planet, forcing the research groups to work under government orders. When the first habitation ships landed and the ramps opened leading the path towards what seemed to be a new era, the live feed sent to earth was enough to provoke a planet wide celebration, after what earth was looking for decades was achieved. This same year, the colonizing volunteers program opened in earth, allowing anyone that passed a simple examination to be sent to this planet.

Months had passed and the expansion in this planet has been swift, even tough most of the planet's surface was covered in water, the few islands were full of fertile soil and rich in metal resources, it has been what earth has been looking for countless years.

Disappearance
--
The citizens lived in what felt like an utopia granted by the planet itself, with more people signing up for the volunteer program in hopes of a new life, but suddenly, what researchers all across earth most feared happened, the planet had vanished from one second to another, not a trace was left. 

Widespread panic was set all across the many islands that had been colonized, having all communication cut off from the capital, all the small governments in the islands quickly gathered across the communication channels to try and discover what happened, it only took a few minutes to realize they were in a completely different solar system after the star they orbited suddenly changed color. Attempts to enter orbit by many ships across the planet failed after what seemed to be a mass sabotage operation that had left all of their ship's engines unusable.

Chaos
--
Hours after all the governments were trying to stablish any form of cohesion to stabilize all their people, these attempts were cut short by a gigantic earthquake that affected the entire planet, bringing down even the strongest of buildings, millions of people died in a few hours and the survivors were left abandoned among the rubble in their islands. To the survivor's surprise,  this earthquake didn't cause an equally as massive tsunami across the planet, but the survivors had bigger problems as monumental structures erected out of nowhere from the sea, opening to reveal massive swarms of drones all across the skies, sadly these drones were not there to help the survivors as they started opening fire with strange weaponry that disintegrated any form of life it touched.

A few days passed after the structures first emerged, the survivors hiding in the rubble of what used to be great cities soon realized the drones were only targeting the higher ups and armored officers instead of those who were normal citizens, using this knowledge they ventured outside their shelters but were soon stopped by extremely aggressive fauna that had creeped into the cities.

Aftermath
--
now, 128 years after the teleportation happened, the few survivors have devolved into small tribes and governments across the islands, trying to survive what now is a wasteland full of technology they have no idea of how to use.
