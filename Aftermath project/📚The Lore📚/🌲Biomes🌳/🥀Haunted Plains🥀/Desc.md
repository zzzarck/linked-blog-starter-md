What seems to be one of the only safe places in Meg'Theos, simple plains with abundant vegetation with what seems like no threats nearby (aside from the dangerous biomes that surround it), is actually a place that doesn't hurt you physically but mentally, people around here claim to see shapes and figures standing on top of the hills around the place, strange people looking at them from windows and screams of loved ones through the night, although no one has been hurt by these entities, many have fallen victim to insanity due to the constant torment of these.
