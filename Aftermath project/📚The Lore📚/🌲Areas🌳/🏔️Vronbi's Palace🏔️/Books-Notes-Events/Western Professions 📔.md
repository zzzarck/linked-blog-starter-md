*Vronbi Ore Scavengers "Palace Thieves"*
--
*The Vronbi Ore Svavengers or as labeled by the locals "Palace Thieves" are unorganized groups or lone scavengers that venture into impact zones caused by the Vronbi near the mountains and look for valuable ore deposits. While not many were seen by our researchers due to the dangerous nature of the profession, it is certaintly a "high risk high reward" mission that some young adventurers are willing to risk their lifes for.

*We were not able to interview anyone that was currently working or used to work as a "palace thief" and most of the information gathered was from the locals that claim to have seen them.

*We don't advice any adventurers to even attempt to gain anything from the profession, this page was writen purely for research purposes.
