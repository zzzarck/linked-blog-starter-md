Vronbi's Palace is a mountainous biome located in the western side of the continent, it is home of the highest peaks and the legendary beasts that the locals have called "vronbi", giant eagle like creatures that come down of the peaks at extreme speeds to hunt anything unlucky enough to be nesr their landing spots.

The area has proven uninhabitable by any creature other than the Vronbi, and attempts to settle any camp here have ceased many years ago as anyone insane enough to venture into the area is quickly mauled alive by the Vronbi.

Even though no one has managed to prospect the area, it is filled with valuable materials beneath the rocky surface, some of them explosed by the impacts the Vronbis create upon landing.
