The Illegal Merchant is my personal project that aims to add a new antagonist to the game, his objective is not to murder or directly sabotage the departments of the station, but to provide both antagonists and normal crewmembers the tools to cause chaos around the station.

Illegal Merchants are offered various styles of playing when they spawn (similar to wraith), these are (Name of the profession might vary):

- Weapons Trafficker
- Drugs Trafficker
- Artifacts Trafficker
- Contractor

Each one has different stuff to sell to the crew and ways to obtain their produce but they all aim to providing the crew with illegal goods.
