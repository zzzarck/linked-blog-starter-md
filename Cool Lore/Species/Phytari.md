The phytari is a glowing fungus that is able to infect compatible plants and give them sentience, while they are very fragile they can quickly expand by adapting to mostly any enviorment and spreading their spores to other plants, their attitude and abilities depend on the type of plant the fungus infected which leads to difficulty in cataloging the many subspecies of phytari, all of them communicate by light patterns emmited by the fungus, however translators do exist for easier understanding.
