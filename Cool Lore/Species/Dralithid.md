these sentient golems are made out of minerals that define their nature, the no need to breathe, eat, and high resistance to anything kinetic makes them highly valuable in any fleet but they are quite rare to come by and dont seem to comunicate in any way, but do somehow understand other species, little is known about them, but investigations on how they are made lead to golems made out of a never seen, green material thats oddly full of motion inside of them, they have been seen shaping, and giving sentience to their golems, to then letting them on their way.
