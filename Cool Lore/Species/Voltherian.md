The voltherians are creatures out of light and power, while they were most likely artificially created nobody really knows about their origins, not even themselves, the voltherians have struggled to adapt but thanks to several technological breaktroughs in their nature, special suits have been made for them allowing them to survive in space and communicate with other species, while they need constant supply of power and cannot interact with most stuff normally, they are very useful since they can manually control pretty much any type of machinery, even bypassing any form of security.
