The thamka are humanoid ants that aesthetically resemble indigenous american tribes and ancient egyptians, the name thamka means "heirs of the earth" in their lenguage, they run a society in a similar way the ancient egyptians did and also are extremely loyal to gods similar to the ones followed by various indigenous tribes, their origins are documented thanks to the humans that created them, the thamka were part of the experiments the humans did to give sentience to various creatures across the galaxy, this is on of the examples of this gone horribly wrong, the experiments failed and gave heavily mutated ants full sentience without of any of the knowledge of how anything works, a massive group of prototypes in the colony managed to pillage a nearby data center which had info about ancient human civilizations and they used it as the foundation of their entire society
